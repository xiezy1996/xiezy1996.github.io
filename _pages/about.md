Hi, I am Ziyi Xie \(Ë∞¢Â≠êÊÄ°\). Welcome to my page üëã
=====

I am pursuing a PhD degree with the School of Electronics and Information Engineering, Harbin Institute of Technology. Before this, I earned a bachelor's degree of communication engineering at Harbin Institute of Technology.

My research interests include reconfigurable intelligent surface aided communications,
