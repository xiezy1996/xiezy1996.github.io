Hi, I am Ziyi Xie. Welcome to my page~
=====

Now I am a PhD student in School of Electronics and Information Engineering, Harbin Institute of Technology. 
This is the front page of a website that is powered by the [academicpages template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) and hosted on GitHub pages. [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com) is a free service in which websites are built and hosted from code and data stored in a GitHub repository, automatically updating when a new commit is made to the respository. This template was forked from the [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll Theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) created by Michael Rose, and then extended to support the kinds of content that academics have: publications, talks, teaching, a portfolio, blog posts, and a dynamically-generated CV. You can fork [this repository](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) right now, modify the configuration and markdown files, add your own PDFs and other content, and have your own site for free, with no ads! An older version of this template powers my own personal website at [stuartgeiger.com](http://stuartgeiger.com), which uses [this Github repository](https://github.com/staeiou/staeiou.github.io).

Educations
------
* Sept. 2018.9 - present, PhD student at Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin
* Jan. 2021 - June 2023, research associate at Queen Mary University of London, London
1. Register a GitHub account if you don't have one and confirm your e-mail (required!)
1. Fork [this repository](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) by clicking the "fork" button in the top right. 
1. Go to the repository's settings (rightmost item in the tabs that start with "Code", should be below "Unwatch"). Rename the repository "[your GitHub username].github.io", which will also be your website's URL.
1. Set site-wide configuration and create content & metadata (see below -- also see [this set of diffs](http://archive.is/3TPas) showing what files were changed to set up [an example site](https://getorg-testacct.github.io) for a user with the username "getorg-testacct")
1. Upload any files (like PDFs, .zip files, etc.) to the files/ directory. They will appear at https://[your GitHub username].github.io/files/example.pdf.  
1. Check status by going to the repository settings, in the "GitHub pages" section

#Publications
#======
#The main configuration file for the site is in the base directory in [_config.yml]###(https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_config.yml), which defines the content in the #sidebars and other site-wide features. You will need to replace the default variables with ones about yourself and your #site's github repository. The configuration file for the top menu is in [_data/navigation.yml]#(https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_data/navigation.yml). For example, if you don't have #a portfolio or blog posts, you can remove those items from that navigation.yml file to remove them from the header.
