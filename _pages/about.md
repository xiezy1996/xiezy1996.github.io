Hi, I am Ziyi Xie \(Ë∞¢Â≠êÊÄ°\). Welcome to my page üëã <a name ="about-me"> </a>
=====

I am pursuing a PhD degree with the School of Electronics and Information Engineering, Harbin Institute of Technology. Before this, I earned a bachelor's degree of communication engineering at Harbin Institute of Technology.

My research focuses on performance analysis on wireless communications. The topics include reconfigurable intelligent surfaces, near-field communications, and next-generation multiple access techniques.

If you are interested in my work or in collaborating with me, please feel free to have a discussion with me (ziyi.xie@hit.edu.cn). I am always looking forward to brilliant minds üòä
